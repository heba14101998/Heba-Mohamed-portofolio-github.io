It is Heba Mohamed from Egypt graduated from the Computer and Communication department of the Benha Faculty of Engineering in July 2021. I'm highly interested in data science, particularly machine learning; I began studying it in September 2020 with the HCIA-AI course, which sparked my curiosity in continuing my education in this sector. After that, I decided that my graduation project would have to be an AI application which push me to learn more and more in this field. Actually, my enthusiasm for data science never wanes, no matter how complicated the data or how difficult the business requirements are.

After graduation, I worked as an instructor and technical support for MUTEX, an educational firm that teaches kids programming and robotics. in addition to working as a freelance lecturer to explain some academic topics to universities students.
