      <description>Abstract Reserving air flights can be a complex problem, especially between cities not connected by a direct flight. The goal of this project is to apply Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest path from starting airport to destination airport, such that minimizes the total travel distance to its destination.
Tools  Python json library. Python math library. Python system library. Python pandas library. Spyder IDE.  Dataset We are given a json file contains a list of airports with some geo-information like city, country and location (longitude, latitude) , airport id as well as airport specific designations (a list of destination airports) as shown below:</description>

      <description>Abstract In tourism and travel-related industries, most of the research on Revenue Management demand forecasting and prediction problems employ data from the aviation industry, in the format known as the Passenger Name Record (PNR). This is a format developed by the aviation industry. The main goal is to generate meaningful estimators from the data set we have and then choose the model that best predicts cancellation by comparing it to the accuracy ratings of several ML models.</description>

      <description>Abstract Buying a home, especially in a city like Bengaluru, is a tricky choice. While the major factors are usually the same for all metros, there are others to be considered for the Silicon Valley of India. With its help millennial crowd, vibrant culture, great climate, and a slew of job opportunities, it is difficult to ascertain the price of a house in Bengaluru.
By cleaning and analyzing the Bangalore home dataset, we will be able to understand how house prices are affected by various factors, and then apply machine learning regression to establish an approximate price for the properties.</description>

      <description>Abstract Skin cancer is the out-of-control growth of irregular skin cells causing the skin to rapidly multiply and form malignant tumors. Between 2008 and 2019 the number of new invasive Melanoma cases rapidly increased by 54%. With such a substantial escalation, it is of great importance for us to inaugurate and build on techniques to assist healthcare providers in diagnosing skin cancer at its preliminary stages.
I developed a classification model for classifying the images to Melanoma or not motivated by the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks in computer vision, I present a CNN-based model from scratch.</description>

      <description>Problem Specifications Indeed is a website that helps connect employers and job seekers through job postings, company reviews, salary data, and more. Because the Indeed site is full of relevant data, organizations can extract job data from the Indeed API for analysis. Web scraping, which is the automatic extraction of data from a webpage, is the best tool for extracting data from Indeed quickly, cheaply, and securely. Through scraping Indeed, an organization can establish a competitive salary, gain understanding of employee sentiment and values, find great candidates, and build a realistic budget for hiring employees and outside contractors.</description>

      <guid>https://heba14101998.github.io/Heba-Mohamed-portofolio-github.io/post/bike-sharing/</guid>
      <description>Problem Specification  Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.</description>

      <description>Problem Specification  In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
Tools   Python 3.</description>
